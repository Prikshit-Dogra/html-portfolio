<h1>The Best Movies According to Golu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3>
<p>This was the movie I was looking forward to becuase 
   Hugh and Deadpool are my favourite actor and superhero.</p>

<h3>Ramayana: Legend of Prince Ram</h3>
<p>This is an Indo-Japan animated project which I love the most as it
   showcases the tale of Ram.</p>
   
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>This movie is like a box of chocolates which I would recommend
   to every individual.</p>
